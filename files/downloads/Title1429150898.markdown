Metaphysics - Philosophy
=====================
#3.0
**Ockham's Razor** - we should eliminate all unnecessary parts of theories
**Metaphysical Dualism** - 2 kinds of reality
**Inference** - both science and metaphysics use to verify theories.
**Metaphysics**- the area of philosophy concerned with the fundamental nature of reality
**Physicalism** - a synonym for metaphysical materialism
**RenÃ© Magritte** - painted The Treachery of Images
**Bottom-line** - strategy that clarifies which things are fundamentally real
**Eliminativist (eliminativism)** - the strategy that eliminates things that are not real
Three categories - non-realities; reducible realities; fundamental realities

#3.1
**identity theory (reductionism)** - denies the existence of a nonphysical mind, but retains language
**Interactionism** - the most common version of dualism - mind and body different, but causually react
**Mind-body dualism** - the mind and body are seperate entities
**Idealism** - Position that asserts the physical and the body are aspects of the mental reality
**Functionalism** The mind is characterized by particular patterns of input -> processing -> output
**Physicalism** - humans can be explained purely by physical or material components

#3.2
**Argument from Doubt**
	1. I can doubt my body exists
	2. I cannot doubt my mind exists
	3. If 2 things do not have exactly identical properties they are not identical
	4. Therefore, mind and body are not the same
**Cerebral Commissurotomy (Corpus callosotomy)** - severing Corpus Callosum nerve bundle
**Pineal Gland** - Descartes solution to interactionism problem
**Interactionsim** - Descartes view that mind and body are separate but interact
**Argument From Consciousness**
	1. Minds have the property of consciousness.
	2. Bodies as materials objects do not have the property of consciousness.
	3. If two things do not have exactly identical properties, then they cannot be identical.
	4. Therefore, the mind and the body are not identical.
**Nonidentity of discernibles (Indiscernibility of identicals)** - no two distinct things exactly resemble each other. - implicit within all of Descartes arguments
**Cartesian Compromise** - science cannot tell us about souls, only bodies.
Three arguments: Argument from Doubt; Argument from Divisibility; Argument from Consiousness
